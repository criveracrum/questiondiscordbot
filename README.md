# questiondiscordbot


This is a Discord bot created to help ensure questions don't get lost within busy channels. This was a problem I recognized in many of the academic channels setup for my classes. Questions would either go unanswered or need to be asked repeatedly. This bot is designed to provide a list of questions that have gone unanswered. 

Created using Node.js and Discord API. The bot was then hosted on AWS instead of being hosted locally. Bot is setup to recognize summons such as mentions in a channel and specific command keywords such as "view" and "question."
